# daily-entry-python-app
A python application hobby project for users who would like to make daily entries, similar to a diary.

I developed this python application as a hobby so that I can practice Tkinter, and playing around with writing to external files. With this basic app, the user can run the python code to be greeted with a Tkinter window with a textbox and submission buitton. The user can write a "daily entry", similar to a diary, and then click the submit button.  Once the entry is submitted, it is written to an external file with a time stamp in a separate directory where it can be accessed later if needed.
